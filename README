MTEX - MATLAB toolbox for quantitative texture analysis

Overview
--------

MTEX is a MATLAB toolbox containing the following features

- Analyze and visualize crystallographic geometries
- Calculate with model ODFs
- Import, analyze and visualize arbitrary diffraction data
- Import, analyze and visualize arbitrary individuell orientation mesurements (EBSD)
- Grain and missorientation analysis
- Recover orientation density functions (ODFs)
- Calculate texture characteristics
- Create publication ready plots
- Writting scripts to process many data sets

For an introduction, please have a look at the help first. If the
toolbox is installed the help can be found in the MATLAB help window
which can be opend by typing 'doc mtex'.
For installation instructions, you can also refer to the file INSTALL
in this directory.
