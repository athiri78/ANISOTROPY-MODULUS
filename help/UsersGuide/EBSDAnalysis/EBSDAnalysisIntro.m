%% First Steps
% Get in touch with EBSD Data in MTEX
%
%% Contents
%
%%
% EBSD Data is stored in the class <EBSD_index.html EBSD> and in the latter
% the class <grain_index.html grain> holds modelled grains.
% The following mindmap may induce an general idea analysing EBSD Data with
% MTEX.

%% Modelling Grains
%
% One basic concept giving spatially indexed EBSD Data structure is done by
% <GrainModelling.html constructing grains>. With grain modelling comes up 
% the possebility getting more information out of EBSD Data - i.a. fabric analysis, characterisation of
% misorientation
%

%% Analyzing EBSD Data
%
% *<EBSDPlot.html Visualizing EBSD Data>* is a central task to understand
% a specimen. The most naive way is plotting of the individual orientations as 
% pole point plots or spatially indexed in some map with colorcoded orientations. 
% Moreover one gets with grains the possibility to take a closer look on grain
% boundaries
